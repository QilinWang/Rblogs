      <description>As mentioned in my previous post, we should continue with a parametric bootstrap simulation. In addition, in part II of this tutorial, I would like to demonstrate how to construct a “bootstrap likelihood” as an alternative to empirical likelihood.
Recall the parametric bootstrap resamples from the parametric distribution evaluated at the MLE estimates of the parameters:
\[f_{\hat \mu} \xrightarrow{iid} x^* \xrightarrow{t} \hat\theta^*\] where \(\hat \mu\) is the MLE estimate of the parameter \(\mu\).</description>

      <description>This is a tutorial I wrote for myself while learning how to correctly implement the BCa (bias-corrected-accelerated) bootstrap confidence interval.
TheoryThe key to understand bootstrap is the two following relationships:
Our statistics of interest, \(\hat\theta\), is calculated from real world data x according to some algorithm \(t(.)\), assuming x is sampled from some unknown distribution F:
\(F \xrightarrow{iid} x \xrightarrow{t} \hat\theta\) In nonparametric bootstrap, our bootstrap statistics of interest, \(\hat\theta^*\), is calculated from bootstrap data \(x^*\) according to some algorithm \(t(.</description>

      <title>Data Analysis with R: A Take Home Test from a Gaming Startup</title>

      <description>I recently finished a take home test from a local start-up. It is my first encounter with such tests, so I think it would be interesting to share my work.
Before we dive in, I would like to say that I probably have made things way more complicated than they need to be. The real

      <title>The Business Model of a Loyalty Program for Mobile Gamers</title>

      <description>I would like to share some thoughts on the business model of a local start-up. The basic idea is this: the company will give out cash rewards in exchange for users spending time on this app and playing games in an uninterrupted manner. Because it actually pays, the ratings of the company is quite good on the Google Play Store.
Is this a great business model? I had thought about it carefully.</description>
