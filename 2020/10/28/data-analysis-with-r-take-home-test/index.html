<p>I have been struggling to understand what the measurement units are for <code>ttime</code>. If it is measured in seconds, then since this company started 2015, the maximum of this number should be</p>
<pre class="r"><code>60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 5</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 157680000</code></pre>
<p>But there are 216 cases with <code>ttime</code> larger than this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>d %&gt;% filter(ttime &gt; 157680000) %&gt;% count</code></pre>
<pre><code># A tibble: 1 x 1
      n
  &lt;int&gt;
1   216</code></pre>
<p>If the unit is in seconds, then the largest number is equivalent to 55 years!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>1735806702 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365 </code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 55.04207</code></pre>
<p>All in all, without any further knowledge, I am hesitant to throw away this many data. In a real world scenario, a statistician must communicate with the client to understand why this is happening.</p>
<p>In this case, however, there is no explanation on these numbers. It is entirely possible that the random number generator used to generate the pseudo data is producing too large a number.</p>
<p>Now let’s get some idea about the distribution.</p>

<p>Since a user cannot have 0 total time, <code>ttime</code> = 0 could mean data is lost or the player got banned for cheating. On the other hand, notice that they have <code>tue</code> (total units earned) = 15, or sometimes 65. It could be that these users got 15 units right off the bat for registering. Perhaps at some period there is another 50 units of bonus for joining. Again, but in real life we need to make sure we understand the data.</p>

<p>Due to the lack of further information, we make the following decision:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Do not trim the outliers</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Because the distribution of <code>ttime</code> has a long right tail that resemble a lor-normal distribution, perform a log transformation</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Change those with zero <code>ttime</code> to missing, so that we can perform log transformation for these observations.</em> (recall log(0) is minus infinity, while log(1) = 0)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Look at the distribution of the transformed column.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>round(quantile(dt$ttime, c(0.001, 0.025,0.05,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.75, 0.9,0.95,0.975,0.99,0.995, 0.999),na.rm = T),0)</code></pre>

<p>The outliers are not as extreme as before. And there are not many outliers. How do we know that? One way in statistics to define outlier is <em>interquartile (IQR for short, which is the difference between the 75% quantile and 25% quantile) plus 1.5 * 75% quantile</em>. We can see that it is 20.80, which means that about 0.1% of the data are outliers while the max is only 21.</p>

<p>The result is interesting. It seems that there are lots of people who spend a lot of time and generate a lot of life time value (by clicking ads, making in-game purchases and providing feedback to game developers) while earning a minimum rewards. This is clearly unrealistic.</p>
<p><strong>Decision: use log transformation. </strong>
<img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Note that log transformation does not help to turn this plot into a normal shape. Box-Cox transformation is an option, but the model usually become harder to interpret after that. On the other hand, log transformation has a natural interpretation, so we stick to it.</p>

<p>Again check the outliers (computed by Q3 + 1.5*IQR).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>IQR(dt$tue, na.rm = T) * 1.5 + quantile(dt$tue, prob =0.75, na.rm = T, names = F)</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 2.483148</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>dt &lt;- na.omit(dt)</code></pre>
<p>The 2d bins is a great way to find the outliers and show difference among groups. We can compare <code>ltv</code> against <code>tue</code>, <code>ttime</code> against <code>ltv</code> and <code>ttime</code> against <code>tue</code> respectively. Squares that are of lighter color means more counts.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(dt, aes(x = ltv, y = tue, color = econ)) + 
  geom_bin2d(na.rm = T) + 
  facet_wrap(~econ) + 
  geom_smooth(method = &quot;loess&quot;, na.rm = T) +

  ylab(&quot;total units earned&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png" width="672" />
We can see that there are a lot of cases that has great <code>ltv</code> but little <code>tue</code> and vice versa. Let us however remove several outliers that are notable: the leftmost point for controls and econ 1, and the upper right extreme point for econ 2.</p>

<h3>Step 2.1.1: Difference of <code>ltv</code> across groups</h3>
<p>I think the frequncy polygons is the best way to display the distribution. Note that the y-axis is scaled so that the maximum density of the purple line (Econ 3) is 1. We can clearly see how the center masses compare against one another: Controls has four times the density as Econ 3 at the highest point of the distribution. Econ 1 has three times the density. This also means Econ 3 has the thickest tails.</p>

<p>To recap, the problem is this:</p>
<p><img src="/img/data_challenge.jpg" style="width:80.0%" /></p>
<p>Each of the four economy regimes has different thresholds for each level. For example, the control group is like this:</p>

<p>To summarize:</p>
<p><strong>First pathway of influence: <code>cumTime</code>(T) up -&gt; <code>cumGXP</code>(G) up -&gt; game level up -&gt; <code>cumUnits</code>(U) up </strong></p>
<p><strong>Second pathway of influence: game level up -&gt; <code>cumPXP</code>(P) up -&gt; player level up -&gt; <code>cumUnits</code>(U) up</strong></p>

<div id="step-2-examine-the-relationship-between-different-variables-in-response-to-time" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 2: Examine the relationship between different variables in response to Time</h3>
<p>Let’s review the question: <strong>how <code>cumTime</code> (T) and <code>cumUnits</code> (U) should relate to <code>cumGXP</code> (G) and <code>cumPXP</code> (P)?</strong></p>
<p>From the diagram, we can see that the only input is <code>cumTime</code>, and it affects the only output <code>cumUnits</code> through both direct and indirect effects of GXP and the direct effect of PXP. We do not have direct control over G and P. We only get to choose one of the four groups.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-2.1-pxp-time" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 2.1: PXP ~ Time</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(econ, aes(x = cumTime, y = cumPXP, color = econ)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~econ)</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png" width="672" />
We can see that for controls, <code>cumPXP</code> rises fastest in response to <code>cumTime</code>, but with a cap at about 50000. Econ 1 and 3 have a higher cap at 200000, but slower PXP accumulation speed, while Econ 2 has a higher cap at 200000 and slowest PXP accumulation speed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>observation: all three economies offer higher PXP cap (four times) in exchange for lower PXP accumulation speed.</p>

<h3>Step 2.2: GXP ~ Time</h3>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can see that for controls, <code>cumGXP</code> rises fastest in response to <code>cumTime</code> with a cap at 1e6. Econ 1 and 3: have a higher cap at 2e6 but slower accumulation speed. Econ 2 has a highest cap at 4e6 and the same slope as Econ 1 and 3.</p>

<p>Observation: all three economies offer higher GXP (twice for Econ 1 and 3 and 4 times for Econ 2) cap in exchange for lower GXP accumulation speed.</p>

<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png" width="672" /><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-38-2.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>we can see that for control, <code>cumUnits</code> rises fastest and has highest cap at about 2071. Econ 1 rises slower and has 2nd highest cap at 1666. Econ 2 and 3 rises slowest but while Econ 2 has the same cap as Econ 1 at 1666, Econ 3 has the lowest cap at 1595.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>observation: all economies cap the <code>cumUnits</code> and slow the payout speed. Control has payout 2071 at max level, Econ 1 and 2 have max payout 1666 and Econ 3 has max payout at 1595.</p>

<div id="step-2.4-units-time-closer-inspection" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 2.4: Units ~ Time, closer inspection</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(econ, aes(x = cumTime, y = cumUnits, color = econ)) +

<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Here I will show why this question is badly designed. The effects of PXP and GXP are confounded with <code>cumUnits</code>. Ideally, to learn how P and G should relate to T and U, we should only vary P and G while holding U fixed. Here, Econ 1 and Econ 3 has exactly the same GXP and PXP plans, and the only difference is that Econ 3 has a lower payout cap and lower payout speed. Consequently, you see that Econ 3 “dominates” Econ 1 in the sense that at any <code>cumTime</code> Econ 1 will have higher payouts than Econ 3.</p>
<p>What does it mean? It means these factors are confounded. The different <code>cumUnits</code> plan affects the relationship between U and T <em>independent</em> of the plans of GXP and PXP.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>observation: Econ 3 and Econ 2, on the other hand, have the same payout speed and similar payout cap (1666 vs 1595). The only difference between Econ 2 and Econ 3 is that Econ 2 has a slower accumulation speed but higher cap for PXP, and a higher cap for GXP.</p>

<div id="step-2.5-how-different-groups-behave-in-the-experiment" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 2.5: How different groups behave in the experiment?</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(dt, aes(x = ttime, y = tue, color = econ)) + 
  geom_point(position = position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 0.1), alpha = 0.1, na.rm = T) +
  geom_smooth(method = &quot;gam&quot;,na.rm = T, se = F) </code></pre>
<pre><code>Warning: position_jitterdodge requires non-overlapping x intervals</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>  # scale_color_brewer(palette=&quot;Set1&quot;)
  # scale_color_manual(values=wes_palette(n=4, name=&quot;Cavalcanti1&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>For a cleaner presentation,</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(dt, aes(x = ttime, y = tue, color = econ)) + 
  geom_smooth( na.rm = T, se = F)</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-41-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>In the experiment data, Econ 1 clearly outperforms control, and Econ 3 clearly outperforms Econ 1. Since Econ 1 and Econ 3 has <em>exactly the same</em> GXP and PXP plan, and the <em>only difference</em> is that Econ 3 has a lower payout cap and lower payout speed, <strong>my conclusion is that the payout speed and cap is what ultimately matters.</strong></p>
<p>To really tell if PXP and GXP matter, we need to compare Econ 2 and Econ 3, <em>which have the same payout speed and similar payout cap (1666 vs 1595)</em>, while Econ 2 has a slower accumulation speed but higher cap for PXP, and a higher cap for GXP. We can see Econ 2 and Econ 3 perform similarly.</p>
<p>To minimize <code>tue</code>, i.e. the payout, <code>cumUnits</code> should have a lower cap and lower accumulation speed. This is the most important aspect. Other than that, slowing PXP and GXP accumulation speed may helps, but it is hard to tell from the data.</p>
<p>So how about the <code>ltv</code>?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(dt, aes(x = ttime, y = ltv, color = econ)) + 
  geom_point( alpha = 0.1, na.rm = T) +
  geom_smooth(  na.rm = T, se = F) + ylim(4.5,8.5) + xlim(11, 18.5)</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-42-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The graph says that there is no difference between these four Econ regimes. In other words, if we only know a user spend 50 hours on the app, then the life time value of this customer is probably the same regardless of economies.</p>
<p>Now the only remaining question is, we want to know that once we “control” for the <code>tue</code> variable, i.e. fixing the number of payout rewards, which economy will give us the highest <code>ltv</code> value? That is, we want <em>to maximize <code>ltv</code> and minimize <code>tue</code></em> at the same time.</p>
<p>The regression itself is very easy.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mod &lt;- lm(ltv ~ ttime + econ + tue, data = dt)
summary(mod)</code></pre>
<pre><code>
Call:
lm(formula = ltv ~ ttime + econ + tue, data = dt)

<p>This result is what we want. The estimates of variable <code>econEcon</code> says that when we fix both the time and the units earned, being in Econ 2 and 3 will increase the <code>ltv</code> the most.</p>
<p>Here is an example to understand what the estimate means: if we have a user who have spent 50 hours on the app and cashed 5 dollars rewards card, then compared to other user who have also spent 50 hours on the app and cashed 5 dollars, being in regime Econ 1, Econ 2, and Econ 3, especially the last two, would mean that the customer has a higher life time value.</p>
<p>Why? Recall that all Econ regimes slow the GXP and PXP progression and payout speed. Perhaps the slower reward speed forces people to spend more in-game, achieve special tasks more diligently or do other activities that generate <code>ltv</code> in order to reach a certain payout.</p>
<p>Next is just some routine checks on the model. The fit is okay.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we know Econ 2 and Econ 3 are best. They are best because they slow the payout speed and reduce the payout caps. Do PXP and GXP accumulation plans have any impact? We cannot tell from the data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My comment: this question is not well designed in several ways. First, the mechanics of the app is not well explained. Second, the experiments are designed arbitrarily. Factors are confounded, causing a lengthy and exhausting analysis to untangle the variables. Third, because the “experiment data” is generated in almost the exact manner (except the center mass), model fitting tells us little information. That being said, experiments are never perfect in real world situations, and one responsibility of a statistician is to try to get the most out of the data.</p>
